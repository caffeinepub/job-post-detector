  "summary": "The BuildRequest requires deploying the application to Internet Computer mainnet while preserving existing configuration, not modifying immutable frontend paths, and maintaining single-actor backend architecture. The diff shows only a modification to project_state.json which tracks feature metadata but does not contain actual deployment changes or mainnet configuration updates. Critical deployment files (dfx.json, canister configurations, network settings) are missing from the diff.",

      "requirement": "Deploy application to Internet Computer mainnet",

However, project_state.json was modified, which tracks features and UI components. While this may be metadata only, the modification was not requested in the BuildRequest which has no explicit requirements.",
